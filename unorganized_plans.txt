Corkboard is one part of a three-pronged approach to rethinking how people participate in communities online. The other parts are Diem (a messaging service) and an as-of-yet untitled e-commmerce service (because no matter how much we'd like to pretend otherwise, compensating each other for goods and services is vital to the survival of any community). All three services will have specifically designed integrations for each other.
What is Corkboard specifically?
Corkboard's core functionality will be as a communal folk literature archive, but it is intended to be customizable enough to extend this functionality to other artforms as users wish, and also be usable as a social media/blog platform, within the context that blogs are often a form of folk literature and social media often serves as folk art.
There are then three primary pieces of this functionality: the literature, the archive, and the ui (users must be able to interact with the archive to access the literature).

The Literature:

The literature will be contained in "posts" (you likely already know what a post is, but i do want to draw attention to the parallels of posting a flyer to a bulletin board [corkboard]). Posts will have the following: required:{ author, at least one: [text content, file content, metatext], content tags [`#untagged` by default], collection tags [`#untagged` by default] }, optional: {likes, comments, reblogs [may not necessarily be called this, but it should be more similar to tumblr reblogs than twitter reposts, so this is the tentative name]}
reblogs will not show any of the metatext or collection tags of previous reblogs; they will only show the metatext and collection tags of the current reblog. reblogs may have their own set of content tags, but they will inherit the original content tags by default.

.cbd file type specifically for sharing static Corkboard posts (if a post is to be readable by outside apps like Diem, it should have its own file type so it doesn't get confused for a different type of file. this file type should only be used for sharing a post and should absolutely not be used in the archive, because it would be too easy for people to edit other people's posts that way. instead, part of the cbd file should link back to the archive point where it was found, and the archive should have a way to convert posts in the archive to indiviual cbd files. also yes cbd is a drug, but it's also an abbreviation for Corkboard. i wanted to do .cbp [CorkBoard Post] but that was taken by Code::Blocks and even though they will likely have very little overlap, i wanted to avoid confusion at all costs)




The Archive:
the archive will be decentralized. every machine running a CorkBoard instance will serve as part of the archive.
.cbdx or even .bin file type for storing collections of posts. read/write access should ideally be limited to the CorkBoard app, but that can always be overridden, so there must be other protections in place to prevent users from editing each other's posts/alterting the archive.



The UI:
